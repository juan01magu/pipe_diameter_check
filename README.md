# Pipe Diameter Check

## Description

This tool calculates or verifies the appropriate diameter of pipes based on input parameters.

## Features

* Calculates the required pipe diameter based on flow rate, fluid velocity, and other parameters.
* Verifies if an existing pipe diameter is sufficient for given conditions.
* Provides options for different pipe materials and standards.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib

## Setup and Installation

## Running the Code

1.  **Run the main script:**
* Run the .py file in VS Code, google collab or other platform with the ability of running this file.

  ## Data Format
* The data should be in a tabular format with three columns, that represent level, velocity and flow in that order.

2.  **View results:** The script will display the calculated pipe diameter or indicate if the existing diameter is sufficient.

  ## Assumptions
 * The script uses certain assumptions in its calculations.  These will be documented in the script.
